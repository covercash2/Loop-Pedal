tasks:
implement a playback loop function.
record until stopped.
playback until stopped.


RECORD:
Enqueue more buffers for recording. this is done in the callback method.

Things to research:
-ActionMode.Callback
---Callback/callbacks
* callbacks are registered with OpenSL objects to be called when a buffer is 
cleared. I need to make sure that I keep track of the number of buffers for
recording/playback reasons. E.g. playback will need to know where the next 
buffer is so it can play it. Same with record. *
---ActionMode

-Menu/menus 
---context menus

AUDIO FORMAT:

pcm (SL_DATAFORMAT_PCM), 
2 channel (channelMask SL_SPEAKER_FRONT_LEFT | SL_SPEAKER_FRONT_RIGHT, 
44.1MHz (SL_PCMSAMPLINGRATE_44_1), 
16 b/sample (SL_PCMSAMPLEFORMAT_FIXED_16), 
little endian (SL_BYTEORDER_LITTLEENIAN).

buffer queue info:

buffer size = 512 16 bit words
storage size = 32768 16 bit words
sample rate = 44,100 Hz
sample size = 16 b/sample

t(A) = 

EQUATIONS

buffer size = B samples
samples = A samples
sample rate = R samples/s
sample size = S b/sample

t(x) = x/R

I think death is least funny when it happens to a child.
